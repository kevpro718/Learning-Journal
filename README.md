# Growth Mindset
Growth mindset to me is a way to mentally prepare yourself for the task or challenges you are about to face, by putting yourself into a positive state of mind.

1 think positively
2 remind yourself of other challenges in the past that you have overcome
3 give yourself a break from time to time to collect your thoughts
