# Growth Mindset
Growth mindset to me is a way to mentally prepare yourself for the task or challenges you are about to face, by putting yourself into a positive state of mind.

*Think positively 


*remind yourself of other challenges in the past that you have overcome


*give yourself a break from time to time to collect your thoughts.
