Basic Terminal usage

pwd

Relative path

A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Tab Completion

When you start typing a path (anywhere on the command line, you're not just limited

to certain commands) you may hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will

invoke an auto complete action. If nothing happens then that means there are several possibilities. 

If you hit Tab again it will show you those possibilities. You may then continue typing

and hit Tab again and it will again try to auto complete for you.
