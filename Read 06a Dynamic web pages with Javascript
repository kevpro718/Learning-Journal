Read 06a Dynamic web pages with Javascript


How Html CSS and Javascript fit together


Where possible try to keep the three languages in separate files,


with the Html page linking to CSS and Javascript files.


The Html gives the page structure and adds semantics.


The CSS enhances the Html page with rules that state


how the Html content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box


dimensions, colors, fonts.


Javascript is how we can change how the page behaves,


adding interactivity.
