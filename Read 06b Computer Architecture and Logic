What Makes a Computer

Input: the information that get put in by an individual

Storage: gets put into memory as data

Process: takes the information and processes it

Output: puts information back out


Circuits and Logic

Every input and output is a type of information

Input and output are types of information which is represented 

by on or off electrical signals or 1's and 0's

In order to process that information, the computer

modifies input signals which uses many electronic

components which form circuits.

CPU Memory Input and Output

A computer can produce different types of output

Speaker

3D printer

robotic arm

cutting tools

3D graphics

It can take multiple CPU's to process this information
