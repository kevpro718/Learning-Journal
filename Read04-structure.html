Html 5 Layout Elements

<header></header>

<footer></footer>

The main header or footer appears at the top or bottom of every page,

the header can be used for the site name, and the footer element,

may contain site information.

<nav></nav>

The <nav> element is used to contain major navigational blocks 
  
  on the site such as the primary site navigation.

<article></article>
  
  The article element acts as a container for any section of a
  
  page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

<aside></aside>
  
  The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether
  
  it is inside an <article> element or not.

  <section></section>
  
  The <section> element groups related content together,
  
  and typically each section would have its own
  
  heading.
  
  <hgroup></hgroup>
  
  The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group
  
  together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> 
  
  elements so that they are treated as one single
  
  heading.

<figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
  
  It can be used to contain any content that is
  
  referenced from the main flow of an article
  
  (not just images).
  
<div></div>
  The <div> element will remain an important way
  
  to group together related elements, because you
  
  should not be using these new elements that you
  
  have just met fo purposes other than those
  
  explicitly stated.
